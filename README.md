Cookiecutter for simple projects by Ephel. This cookiecutter tries to use
the most modern Python setup without the full complexity of [Hypermodern Python cookiecutter].

## Features

### Workflow

This cookiecutter proposes a workflow organized with [directory structure](#directory-structure).

The overall choices of packages is inspired from [Hypermodern Python cookiecutter].

This data science project template is inspired from [cookiecutter-modern-datascience]
for the directory structure.

The cookiecutter [data-science-template] by Khuyen Tran was also very much used.

## Quickstart

The file `Makefile` will be used repeatedly hereinafter to automate many of
the tasks. It automatically configured by the cookiecutter to include, the
repo name, project name, etc.

### Step 1 Setup the project structure with `cookiecutter`

Change to the parent location where you want the project to be created.
For example if your project is called `project-proj` in the `parent` folder,
then move to `parent` first

    cd ../parent

verify that `cookiecutter` is properly installed by calling its version

    cookiecutter --version

then generate the project

    cookiecutter https://github.com/FrankLef/cookiecutter-proj.git

and **make the new folder the working directory**.

### Step 2 Manage the dependencies with `poetry`

Run `poetry shell` to open the poetry shell and avoid having to always add
`poetry run`in front of all commands

    poetry shell

Run the `make` command `poetry_update` so that the following `poetry` command
will run

1. `poetry update`: The `poetry.lock` file will be created and the virtual
environment updated with the right packages and versions
2. `poetry show`: To verify if there are inconsistencies

These steps are encoded in the Makefile and can be run as follows

    make poetry_update

Sometimes, especially when reusing a folder that had been used as a project
before, the old environment is still used. To see the environment curently
opened by `poetry` use this

    poetry env list

To delete the old environment use this command

    poetry env remove <python>

### Step 3 Setup the new `.git`

#### Create repo in `github`

First create the new repo in github

* **Give the repo the exact same name as the project**. That is keep the
underscore in the name when there one. i.e. flproj_todo is also flproj_todo
in github.
* Don't create `README`, `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` with the new repo they
will be overriden anyway.

#### Initialize the repo

Then initialize git using

    make git_init

### Step 4 Add the ignored directories

Some directories, such as the `data/`, are included in `.gitignore` and therefoer
ignored by the cookicutter which is coming from `git`. Run `make` to add these
extra directories. The most usual one is `data`.

    make ignored_dir

### Step 5 Install `pre-commit`

Once `.git` is setup, make sure to include the pre-commit script in `.git`
by running `pre-commit install` from the poetry shell. Also `pre-commit update`
ensures that the `black`, `flake8` etc. are up-to-date. Sometimes warnings
appear about the 'rev' field being mutable, using this `pre-commit update`
usually resolves this.

These steps are encoded in the Makefile and can be run as follows

    make pre_commit

It is also a good idea to run the hooks against all files when adding a new hook

    pre-commit run --all-files

### Step 6 Verify the features

It is also useful to test the features of the new project before embarking
in the coding.

#### Code source format and check

To run `isort` and `flake8` and verify all is in order run this make command

    make lint

#### Create the documentation with `mkdocs`

You can also verify that the documentation setup is working by building
the site.

Note: For some reason I am unable to run mkdocs from `poetry` with

    poetry run mkdocs serve

As a result, the following command which must be run
**outside the `poetry shell`**. That is it **must be run from the terminal**.

    mkdocs serve

Then you update the documentation with

    mkdocs build

There is more information at [real python] on using `mkdocs`.

**Important:**

#### Code testing with `pytest`

Finally you can verify that `pytest` is working as expected by using
this command wich runs the tests from the `tests` directory.

    pytest

## Setup notes

When using the configurations recommended usually as best practices problems
were encountered. They are described as well as their solutions below.

You can also read the `pyproject.toml` provided by this cookiecutter to see
info on the required changes.

### `flake8`

`flake8` reports error **E501** for lines exceeding the 79 length limit
recommended by PIP-8. Even when `black` is ok with it and even when all lines
are properly formatted and abide by the rule.

Several hours were spent trying to fix it. The solution used here is
as follows:

* Modify `pyproject.toml` to include a section **tools.flake8** to tell
`flake8` to ignore E501 with `ignore=E501`.
* Add the plugin `flake8-pyproject` to the **tool.poetry.dependencies** section
of `pyproject.toml` because `flake8` does not use the `pyproject.toml` except
when the `flake8-pyproject` is installed.
* Modify `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to add `args: [--ignore=E501]` to the
flake8 hook.

### `pyarrow`

Use `pyarrow.feather` instead of `feather-format`, `feather.format` exists only
for backward compatibility. `pyarrow` should be installed with
`pip3 install pyarrow` in the local python. Don't install `pyarrow` with
`poetry add pyarrow` or you will get a whole lotof cryptic errors.
